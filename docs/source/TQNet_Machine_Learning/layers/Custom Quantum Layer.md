# Custom Quantum Layer
## Introduction to CQ

The Custom Quantum (CQ) layer is a novel approach designed to integrate quantum layers with classical neural network layers, creating a syngergistic hybrid model. The CQ layer leverages the non-linear transformations inherent in quantum circuits to express a wide range of functions, creating a richer and more stable representation of the input data, which can then be further distilled by subsequent classical layers. The CQ approach is highly flexible and allows for complete control over the design of the quantum circuit. 

This architecture offers unprecedented expressivity of complex data features and navigation of critical challenges in high-dimensional search spaces (such as vanishing gradients and barren plateaus) â€“ representing a path forward in the development of more powerful, efficient, and adaptable machine learning models for complex real-world problems.

## Key Benefits

- Enhanced Expressivity: The CQ layer leverages quantum circuits to perform non-linear transformations on input data, accessing a rich frequency spectrum that allows for more complex feature representation than classical neural network layers alone. 
- Mitigation of Training Obstacles: By enabling precise control over circuit design, the CQ layer helps address vanishing gradients and barren plateaus - common challenges in both quantum and deep classical neural networks. This allows for more effective training, even in deep hybrid architectures.
- Efficient High-Dimensional Data Processing: The quantum nature of the CQ layer allows it to navigate large search spaces more efficiently than classical approaches, making it particularly well-suited for high-dimensional data problems.
- Complementary to Classical Layers: When stacked with classical neural network layers, the CQ layer acts as a powerful feature extractor. It provides a rich, non-linear transformation of the input data that can then be further refined by classical layers, resulting in a distilled representation of the most relevant features.
- Customizable Feature Extraction: The flexibility to design any desired quantum circuit within the CQ layer allows users to tailor the feature extraction process to specific problem domains or data structures.
- Noise Resilience: The non-linear transformations performed by the CQ layer can help in extracting stable features from noisy data, which can then be further processed by classical layers to produce a clean, precise representation of the underlying patterns.
- Lightweight yet Powerful Models: By combining the expressive power of quantum circuits with the proven effectiveness of classical neural networks, hybrid models incorporating the CQ layer can achieve high performance with potentially fewer total parameters than purely classical approaches.
- Potential for universal function approximation


## Hyperparameters and Default Settings
The following hyperparameters are included in the CQ layer. These are not necessarily the recommended settings for every application or use case; they may require tuning to find the optimal values for your specific use case.
