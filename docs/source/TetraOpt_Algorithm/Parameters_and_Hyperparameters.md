# Parameters and Hyperparameters
Every problem will have a problem dimensionality determined by the domain of the objective function.

|`iteration_number` | int     | Maximal iteration number for TetraOpt.                                                                                                                                                                              |
|`quantization` | boolean | Whether or not to use quantization, or virtual dimension as it is called elsewhere. Using virtual dimension allows tensors to be reshaped if their sizes are of composite integers.                                 |
|`points_number` | int     | Determines the number points to discard after every iteration.                                                                                                                                                      |
|`tolerance` | float   | Desired tolerance for the algorithm.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|`upper_limits` | array   | Set upper limits for the objective function arguments.                                                                                                                                                              |
|`lower_limits` | array   | Set lower limits for the objective function arguments.                                                                                                                                                              |
|`grid` | array   | Number of grid points for the objective function arguments to optimize. TetraOpt performs an optimization over a discretized space, whose grid is determined by this parameter.                                     |
|`objective function` | URL     | This is the URL for the endpoint defining the objective function. For example: https://test.test                                                                                                                    | 
|`seed` | int     | Two experiment runs with the same seed value (for the same problem and other parameters) will be exactly the same. By default it is generated by hardware random engine, so each time different seed value is used. | 
|`device` | string  | "CPU" or "GPU"                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
|`start_points` | array   | Optionally supplied points to be used at the initialization of the algorithm in addition to the random ones.                                                                                                        | 
|`precision` | string  | "float64" or "float32"                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
|`point` | string  | "float64" or "float32"                                                                                                                                                                                              |
